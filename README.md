# Mission to Mars

## Overview of Project
This project was done to learn about web scraping using Splinter and Beautiful Soup, as well as MongoDB and Bootstrap.

### Goals 
The goals were to:
* Use Splinter and Beautiful Soup to create functions for web scraping
* Use Python and MongoDB to automate scraping and write to a new webpage
* Work with Bootstrap and css to customize the results

### Additional skills
This challenge presented a new level of difficulty. Some skills practiced:
* Troubleshooting code
* Using Stack Overflow and reviewing different answers for applicability
* Keeping code clean and folders organized
* Keeping track of helpful links, attempts, and screenshots for reference
* Being able to isolate problems and have code ready when asking for help


## Results
After struggling with the early stages, I got stuck at "almost there" for a long time. Now that all my little tweaks are showing up, I have to say: SHE'S SO PRETTY!!!
